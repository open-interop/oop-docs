This is the initial release of the community Open Interop documentation website. Open Interop enables data collection from varied sources, translation and manipulation of data, and forwarding on to connected endpoints.

We will be providing documentation on how to use, install, and deploy open interop from Github as well as the Docker Hub releases.

<!--more-->

Currently, the only documentation released is [the API](https://api.openinterop.org) documentation as well as [installation via Docker Hub](/installation#via-docker-hub) using docker-compose. Both of these should be considered as an alpha release, they are incomplete and are being constantly updated.

User's are welcome to add to the documentation themselves by forking the documentation repository and adding a pull request. See more information on the [Contributing](/contributing) page.
